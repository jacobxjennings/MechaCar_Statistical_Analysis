## Part Four: 
To compare the MechaCar to competition, additonally testing will be needed. The metrics that should be observed are the cost, city and highway fuel efficiency, horse power, and safety rating. The testing should compare the sttatistical variability of MechaCar in each metric. The null hypothesis should be MechaCar is not statistically different from tthe competition, where the alternative hypothesis is that MechaCar is statically variable against competition. We would use T-tests to see if MechaCar rates higher or lower statistically and the data needed would be industry data reports on safety, fuel efficiency, and horsepower of top vehicle makes and models.
